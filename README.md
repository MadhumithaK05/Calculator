# Calculator
Mini Python Project 

## Abstract
In this project a graphic user interface(GUI) simple calculator is built using Tkinter in python.
Out of all the GUI methods, Tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with Tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create GUI applications. We can perform various operations like addition, multiplication, subtraction and division in this calculator.

## Description
Tkinter is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. It is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit, and is Python's de facto standard GUI. Tkinter is included with standard Linux, Microsoft Windows and macOS installs of Python.
The name Tkinter comes from Tk interface. Tkinter was written by Steen Lumholt and Guido van Rossum, then later revised by Fredrik Lundh.
Tkinter is free software released under a Python license.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10.1
- Tkinter

## Design
The following are the “must haves” for this app:
1. An equation line (screen) to display the click actions and the result.
2. Buttons must have values and be clickable.
3. Perform mathematical operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division).
4. Perform equation calculation (=) and clearing the screen (c).

## STEPS INVLOVED:
 - Step 1: Build GUI main screen for calculator in Python 
 - Step 2: Add the equation line to GUI main screen
 - Step 3: Create buttons for calculator in Python
 - Step 4: Add buttons to GUI
 - Step 5: Assign Actions to Buttons
